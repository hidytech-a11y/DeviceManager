    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=DeviceManagerDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
  }
}
```

### 2. Configure Email Settings

Add your email configuration to `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Email": {
    "SmtpHost": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "SmtpPort": "587",
    "Username": "your-email@gmail.com",

   -- Find the Admin role ID
   SELECT Id, Name FROM AspNetRoles WHERE Name = 'Admin';
   
   -- Assign the role
   INSERT INTO AspNetUserRoles (UserId, RoleId) 
   VALUES ('user-id-here', 'admin-role-id-here');
   ```
